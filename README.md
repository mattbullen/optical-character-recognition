## Mobile OCR and Language Translation

This was an experiment in using the ocrad.js optical character recognition library in a mobile app. I built it using Telerik.com's cordova.js mobile app framework.

Once you open the app, you'll see a `<canvas>` input area at the top of your phone's screen. Draw a word and the app will detect the characters making up the word, then translate the word into the language of your choice. Depending on the sensitivity of your phone's screen to touch events, you might notice that the OCR functionality works best if you draw simple block letters.
